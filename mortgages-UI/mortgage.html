                <p>
                    The residential mortgage market in the UK is a complex one, with a myriad of products available,
                    each with its own set of features and terms. It's something that can make choosing the right option
                    for your needs very tricky and with the repercussions of making the wrong selection so undesirable,
                    it pays to have an expert on your side.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Choosing an unsuitable mortgage might lead to higher monthly payments, excessive fees or even early
                    payment penalties. Moreover, opting for an unaffordable mortgage might result in defaults,
                    repossession or long term financial strain. However, with the experts from Wealthmax Financial
                    Advisers to help, you can make the best, most informed decision.</p>

                        A mortgage is a big commitment for anyone, and the unpredictability of life means that mortgage
                        cover is wise. In the event of losing your job or becoming incapacitated through illness or
                        injury,
                        you need to think about whether you could continue to meet your mortgage payment obligations.

                        home if you cannot keep up with the repayments.
